# Malware-Analysis-Baseline-script

These scripts are for conducting a baselining before and after malware behavioral analysis.

Baseline.py is utilized to gather Service, Port, Process, Directory walk, Local User accounts, and File integrity check of C:\Windows before malware behavioral analysis begins. It is recommended to run this script on a fresh boot before starting any monitoring software or honeypot software. 

After the malware is executed, the Baseline.py script should be executed again, and then both files should be analyzed through the diff_triage.py file to determine what changes may have occured.
